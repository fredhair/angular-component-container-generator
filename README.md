# angular-component-container-generator

Run the gencomponent.sh from bash inside the root of an angular project.

You could either put this script in your local bin folder to make it globally accessible.


Example use:

gencomponent my-component

will run ng g c my-component and will also scaffold the interpolated template files into the same component directory.
